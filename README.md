# ATM Simulator

Project by Dhanush M and Eshwar K 

# Project Description
The ATM Simulator is a command-line application written in C that emulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The project incorporates Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to efficiently manage account data and perform transactions. Users can create accounts, make deposits, withdrawals, check balances, and delete accounts.

# Features

Account Creation:

Users can create new accounts by providing their name, account number, password, and an initial deposit.

File Storage:

Account information is stored in a file (accountt.txt) using efficient data structures.

Deposit:

Account holders can deposit money into their accounts, increasing their balance.

Withdrawal:

Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided they enter the correct password.

Balance Checking:

Account holders can check their account balance after entering the correct password.

Account Deletion:

Users can delete their accounts by providing the account number and confirming the password.
